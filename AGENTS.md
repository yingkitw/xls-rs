# Agent Development Loop

This document defines the continuous improvement cycle for the project.

## The Loop

### 1. Complete Remaining TODO Items
Pick the next highest-priority item from `TODO.md` (or `ARCHITECTURE.md` if the task is architectural). Implement it with minimal, focused changes. Do not add speculative features.

### 2. Create Tests and Examples
For every new capability:
- Write tests in `tests/integration.rs` that exercise the feature end-to-end
- Add unit tests for core logic where appropriate
- Provide a minimal usage example if the feature is client-facing

### 3. Ensure `cargo test` Passes
Run the full test suite (`cargo test`). Fix any failures before proceeding. Warnings are acceptable but should be noted.

### 4. Loop Back to Step 1
Return to `TODO.md` and pick the next item. Repeat until the backlog is clear.

### 5. Audit and Optimize
After each batch of features, perform a quality pass:
- **Maintainability**: Are functions small and well-named? Is the module structure logical?
- **Leanness**: Remove dead code, unused imports, and speculative abstractions
- **Wiring**: Ensure all new features are properly integrated into `main.rs`, `Cargo.toml`, and docs
- **Small footprint**: Avoid unnecessary dependencies; prefer the standard library or lightweight crates
- **Consistency**: Match existing code style and patterns

### 6. Competitive Intelligence
Research similar open-source spreadsheet and data tools (openpyxl, excelize, SheetJS, calamine, xsv, polars, duckdb, miller, csvkit, visidata, pandas, etc.). Identify capabilities they have that this project lacks. Add the most valuable ones to the `TODO.md` brainstorming section. Prioritize features that provide clear competitive advantage.

### 7. Update Documentation
Keep all project docs aligned with the current implementation:
- **`README.md`**: Quick start, feature list, architecture summary
- **`TODO.md`**: Mark completed items, move them to Done, keep brainstorming current
- **`SPEC.md`**: Scope and requirements for the site, technical stack, quality bar
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md`**: Module relationships, data flow, deployment topology
- **`AGENTS.md`**: This file — update if the loop itself evolves

## Principles

- **Simplicity over flexibility**: Solve the problem at hand, not every hypothetical future problem
- **Surgical changes**: Touch only what you must; clean up only your own mess
- **Goal-driven**: Every change should have a verifiable success criterion
- **Test before ship**: No feature is complete until it has passing tests
- **Docs are code**: Documentation drift is a bug
